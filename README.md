NSL Satara Wind Project in Maharashtra India

The proposed project activity is an initiative taken by M/s NSL Wind Power Company (Satara) Private Limited in district Satara of Maharashtra state, India. The technology being employed in the project activity will comprise 20 numbers of Wind Energy Convertors (WECs) having capacities of 1500 kW each. The total capacity of the proposed project activity will be 30 MW. The project activity is expected to generate, which will be exported to the Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MAHATRANSCO), which falls under the Northern, Eastern, Western and North-Eastern regional grids (NEWNE) grid of India. The spatial extent of the project boundary is the NEWNE grid.

The project activity involves electricity generation by renewable source (Wind energy) and 
supplying the generated electricity to the state grid system i.e., Maharashtra State Electricity 
Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), which falls under the Northern, Eastern, Western and 
North-Eastern regional grids (NEWNE) grid of India, now Unified Indian Grid. The supply of 
electricity is confirmed from registered VCS Project Description version 03 dated 08-February
2016/3/, Group credit notes issued by MSEDCL (Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. 
Ltd.), Invoices raised by PP to MSEDCL (Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd.) /27/ 
and, last verification report/12/ and interview with PP/39/. The spatial extent of the project 
boundary is the NEWNE (Now Unified Indian Grid) located in Village: Mann in Satara district of 
state- Maharashtra.

The first WTG under the project was commissioned on 6 th March 2014 and the project is under
continuous operation since then. The entire project was fully commissioned as on 31
st March 2014.

The project was mainly invested based on carbon revenue; hence the project was initially submitted
for registration under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); however, it was not registered.
Subsequently, it was submitted for registration under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)
mechanism and got registered as (VCS ID 1519) to secure position under voluntary platform. The
crediting period of the project under VCS was started on 6 th March 2014 and ends on 5
th March 2024. The project has already claimed carbon credits under VCS for the period “6
th March 2014 to 5
th Mar 2024”. Thereafter, the project was considered under VCS mechanism till 5
th March 2024. However, the project has not been further under VCS beyond 5
th March 2024. In continuation with the same, the UCR project has been considered crediting of GHG emission
reductions from 6 th March 2024. Hence, the first monitoring period considered under UCR is from
6 th March 2024, thus there is no concern of double accounting of emission reductions.
